Lumber
======

Lumber is a sysadmins best friend. It is the perfect
activity logging application for those who like life 
simple and effortless. Lumber actively tracks your 
activity and allows you to divide your tasks up into 
searchable logs that can contain particular tasks.

####v1.0 Goals
Version one will allow you to track a single user's
activity and group commands according to job. It may
also allow shell specific log tracking but this may
be crude at first.

####v2.0 Goals
Version two will add multi-user support as well as
a more elegant shell specific tracking. I also want
to add config file version control to this version.
It should be able to keep a database of log files 
and recognise when one is changed although how 
effectively this is done might be a curve.
